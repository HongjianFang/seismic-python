# SeismicPython
Most day to day programming tasks in seismology consist of building a workflow connecting reusable data structures with some number of processing steps. Python packages such as [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki "ObsPy Wiki") and the [Antelope](http://www.brtt.com/home.html "BRTT.com") Python API afford many tools to accomplish such tasks. **SeismicPython** is envisioned to be an extension to and interface between these packages, adding new functionality where these packages are lacking and facilitating use of complementary functionality existing in these two packages.
